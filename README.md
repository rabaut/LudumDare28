Ludum Dare 28 Theme: You only get one.  

Move around a randomly generated 2D maze made out of 0's and 1's.  

You play as a 1 that can pair up with up to 3 other binary numbers to form a single hex value.  

The goal is to create all the possible hex values in under 1 minute.  
Manipulate the map by reducing obstacles into hex values to help you reach the bonus items!  

Using SFML 2.1 and C++
