===========

Ludum Dare 28 Theme: You only get one.  

Move around a randomly generated 2D maze made out of 0's and 1's.  

You play as a 1 that can pair up with up to 3 other binary numbers to form a single hex value.  

Score is calculated by adding up all the currently created hex values. There are bonus items  
denoted by a @ that are converted to a hex value between A-F when touched. Manipulate the map  
by reducing obstacles into hex values!  

Using SFML 2.1 and C++
